Another big change is the images. I was facing a delima: images I can use without copyright issues are boring, while images that has the strongest visual impact can't be used because of copyright. Eventually I purchased license from Depositphotos to download their photos. I want to create impactful story while not damaging my integrity as a future arts manager. I thik I made the right decision.



## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The audience include people who are curious about Gaokao and who cared about Gaokao. I hope the previous audience group would have a basic understanding of the complexity and importance of Gaokao after going through my data story. My second audience group are policy-makers and educators who cared about Gaokao and its impacts, and most importantly, the students that has to go through Gaokao. 

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
