# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

I added the call to action section at the end. I got inspiration from my parents when interviewing them for my latest iteration of design. The best way to address "what can audience do with the information from the story" is to connect it to the future, and AI is the inevitable future. For most people, Gaokao is a pathway to higher education, which is directly associated with good jobs. But the job market is changing drastically, with AI being one of the reason. Gaokao has exsisted for more than 40 years, but no one can say for sure that it will continue exsisting in the future as the world changes. It might be harmful for people to continue glorify Gaokao as a challange that put one's knowledge, determination and perseverance to test, instead of viewing it as a not-very-effecient selecting system. So, now might be the time to reevaluate the system.

I know it is easier said than done, and my story didn't provide an actionable solution. But in order to improve amything, it is key to see the problem first. And that's what my story trying to achieve.

I debated whether to add a timeline summarizing the history of Gaokao and its reform over the years. I didn't add it becasue 1.while it is nice to have, it does not add more impact to the main takaway of my story (Gaokao is important and messy); 2.design-wise, it is hard to edit and took too much time to make it pretty.



## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The audience include people who are curious about Gaokao and who cared about Gaokao. I hope the previous audience group would have a basic understanding of the complexity and importance of Gaokao after going through my data story. My second audience group are policy-makers and educators who cared about Gaokao and its impacts, and most importantly, the students that has to go through Gaokao. 

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

The biggest change is the images. I was facing a delima: images I can use without copyright issues are boring, while images that has the strongest visual impact can't be used because of copyright. Eventually I purchased license from Depositphotos to download their photos. I want to create impactful story while not damaging my integrity as a future arts manager. I thik I made the right decision.

In Part II I said to avoid using big block of text. To do so, I break my big text blocks into shorter paragraphs with graphs embedded inbetween. I want to best ultilize the scrolling feature of Shorthand to create something visually dynamic.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

The project is harder than I imagined. Not hard to make, but takes more time to make it as "perfect" as I want it to be. There is no pre-organized dataset ready to use, so I have to scrap my own data. I hope I could create more professional-looking designs, but for now I think I managed to do my best. I also struggled to obtain appropriate images as mentioned before. While I like this project and full-heartedly want to create a great work, endless investment of time and energy is not realistic. It is key to mindfully allocating limited time to get the most of a design.
