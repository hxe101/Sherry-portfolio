# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.

# About me
Hello :) This is Sherry Xueer Hao. I am a 2nd year MAM (Master of Arts Management) at Heinz College, and I will be graduating this May. My home is Beijing, China.

Fun facts about me: I practice fencing and swordfight people two times a week.

I have two dogs back home with my parents (you can ask me to show you my dog pics anytime!)

# What I hope to learn
1. How to evaluate if a graph / dataviz is good, and why is it good / not good.
2. Explore new resources and platforms (like this one!) that I would otherwise not try out myself.
3. Creat accurate, well-designed and narratively interesting graphs.

Plan after graduation:
In the next 3 to 4 years after graduation, I'd like to work at a museum or visual art nonprofit, in a medium sized city (like Pittsburgh) with flourish art community. Position of interest would be development, programming and general management.

Or working for Semester At Sea (it is a college program on the cruise, what's not to love!)

# Examples

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
The insipiration for the final project came from chatting with a non-Asian friend. They said they've heard Gaokao was a crazy experience, but didn't know how accurate that statement is. I imagine that people who weren't born and raised or go to school in China will probably have the same impression. I think topics that are vaguely familiar to the audience would be worthy to dive deeper into: it is not too niche and audience might be curious to learn more about it.

Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.
