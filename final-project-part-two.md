# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

I made a major scope change in the second stage of the draft.

Upon initial research, I realized there isn't enough data to support my designed narration. Despite being a national exam, Gaokao is highly defined by regional policy, and all the data I came across reflected that. It is hard to visualize a national trend when every source talking about Gaokao focuses on regional trends.

I also realized that Gaokao being highly-defined-by-region is an unique characteristic I didn't paid much attention to before. So I think it will be a nice new approach to the include in the projet.

Insipred by the Netflix Explained mini documentary series, I decided to frame my project as one too.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.

People who haven't take the exam, but had heard stories about it and is curious to know more.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |

|Accurate information|Is the key points in my outline accurate? (This question is designed after the change of scope, and aiming for my audience who had taken the exam and had a basic understanding of the concept.)                  |
|Gain additional insights from my audience|How do you suggest I continue building this project? What other aspects of the topic you'd like to see?                 |

| Questions               | Interview 1: Roommate who had taken Gaokao before | Interview 2| Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|How is the layout/visual design looks to you? Is it easy to read the text and absorb information?| The images, espically the book-walls on the desks, reminded me of my time preparing for the exam. (She also catches a few typoes.)           |The opening pages created a good hook and really captured my attention!             |             |
|Is the key points in my outline accurate? | Confirmed. She also mentioned that other provinces' policy and admission rate were not important to her when she took the exam. It shows that for an individual the national trend might not be that obvious or relavent, despite how it might impact.|     /      |      /      |
|How do you suggest I continue building this project? What other aspects of the topic you'd like to see?|                                |Include personal story/narrative to make the narration more impactful. You can include both the good and the bad personal expereince to create a more complex narration.             |A timeline showing the history of Gaokao. Not the full history but definetely include major events.             |
